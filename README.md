# Todo-it

Todo-it is a sample Pedestal application developed from scratch. Read more information below, or in the accompanying [slides](TODO).

## Usage

### Pre-requisites

* Install [JDK 7+](http://bit.ly/java-download)
* Install the [Leiningen build tool](http://leiningen.org/#install)
* Clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/rkneufeld/pedestal-workshop`)

### Running the application

Inside `pedestal-workshop/`, run the command `lein run`. The first
time you run this command Leiningen will fetch and install all of the
applications dependencies.

Once the application starts, you will see something like the following:

```sh
$ lein run
INFO  org.eclipse.jetty.util.log - Logging initialized @10299ms
INFO  org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server - jetty-9.1.3.v20140225
INFO  o.e.j.server.handler.ContextHandler - Started o.e.j.s.ServletContextHandler@6d0433ee{/,null,AVAILABLE}
INFO  o.e.jetty.server.ServerConnector - Started ServerConnector@32af198c{HTTP/1.1}{0.0.0.0:8080}
INFO  org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server - Started @10431ms
```

At this point, the application is ready. Visit or cURL
<http://localhost:8080/hello> to verify the application is running
properly (all but the very first commit should respond).

### Following along with the workshop

The slides for following along with this workshop are available at <http://TODO>.

Branches exist for each exercise, allowing you to `git checkout
checkpoint-x` and start with a clean, working state.
